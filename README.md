# Guess the Number Game 
Overview

This is a browser-based, interactive number-guessing game designed to test a player’s guessing skills within limited attempts. The player selects a range of numbers and then tries to guess a randomly generated number within that range. Feedback and hints guide the player, and a win/loss modal appears when the game is over, with the option to play again.
# How to Play

- Select a range (10, 100, or 1000) using the radio buttons.
- Click "Start" to begin the game.
- Enter guesses in the input box and press "Check" to see if you’re correct.
- Use hints and track remaining guesses until you find the correct number or guesses run out.
- Play again by clicking the “Play again” button in the modal.
